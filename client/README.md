# React Compiler

The React Compiler is enabled on this template. See [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) for more information.

Note: This will impact Vite dev & build performances.

# Run Client

`bun run dev` will start a dev server on http://localhost:5173

# Build Client

To build the client ready for a production deployment use `bun run build` this will create a bunch of static files in the `dist` folder ready for copying to the server/ui folder

# Testing Client

`bun run lint` will run the linter. Linter warnings must be treated as errors and resolved.

There are currently no unit or integration tests in the client
